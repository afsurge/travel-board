x Q: ORDER BY query instead of unshift images? -> reverse() response.data before passing to self.image (script /get) -> ORDER BY after checking Part4
x Q: continue storing locally in /uploads folder? -> Merle: can remove after upload to s3, use "fs.unlink(path,()=>{});" in s3 (commented now/David)
x Q: reset all images uploaded? remove from tables, remove from s3? -> Merle: remove from tables, link to delete from s3 -> saved in slack
