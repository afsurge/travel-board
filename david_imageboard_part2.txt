Cluster - maximizing the handling of load

Further upgrade by adding servers - "scaling" - horizontal

Centralized permanent location for files

Cloud computing - Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Same thing by Heroku can be done with AWS - bit more complicated

Heroku made based on AWS but easier, user-friendly

S3 - Simple Storage Services - upload files and available for use by websites - entirely diff machine as our server running

SES - Simple Email Service - next project

AWS competitors - Google Cloud Services, Microsoft Azure

AWS most widely used and popular compared to others

Create new AWS account or use Spiced account for project

Own account might be necessary in future - need credit card

Companies might have their own accounts for use already

Spiced account credentials must not be committed! - secrets.json file - credentials provided in notes to add - David's account!

secrets.json already added in .gitignore - create file in root - check everytime git add, git status that secrets not committed!

Created secrets.json - empty now

David shows setup - root user - also my account present but without CC info

IAM - Identity Access Management

Access to David's AWS account upto 6 weeks after graduation - security reasons

Got AWS credentials from Spiced notes link - same for everyone who uses Spiced account - shown once after clicking button - next time link can only create new access credentials

S3 - Buckets - spicedling access only for students

Making own account steps in notes - went through in class

Code along - new s3.js middleware file - code from notes

Added to /upload post route in server - after multer uploader
